	Several challenges overcame and still outstanding.....
	______________________________________________________________________________________
	{ Success With : }  
		Implemented a few solutions for querying the database from a  webpage
			first:       was just typing the query into the address bar was successful
			Second: Was a proper query method, 
			1. using an HTML form input field , 
			2. use Submit and post to submit to and grab query via flask
`			3. verify there are not restricted words in the query that could be harmful
			to the database, ie , "delete", "drop", "create" NEED to ADD  "insert"
			4.  if restricted word found in query , throws exception to user
			5.  implemented easy , try / except for eligible query 
				if any SQL Alchemey error thrown , we throw error message to user 
				app does not fail
			6. IF query is success, we dynamically generate a results table in HTML
 				a. I used Jinja For Loop method with a loop in a loop 
				     to create, a row and table data cell for each item in the list 
				b. I used jinja if index loop is even or odd to implement color style 
			                          so everyother row is a alternating background color for readability

	______________________________________________________________________________________
	{Outstanding Issues: }

		A. Column names for results table
			* I tried everything but a pandas Dataframe solution with no success to get column 			   		 names returned with the query - it is the weirdest thing , it should be an option...
	______________________________________________________________________________________
	{ Next Features: } 
		A. Drop down list , of saved querys, or views 

		B. A solution for, users to save query, as a view or just text 
			* it would be saved to a new table for just that
			* we will dynamically create a drop down list of saved querys by querying that 
				saved query table on page load
		C. CLick Query:
			* create a click or drop down selection for various query terms and table names, and 			  column names

		D. Admin Login:
			A. Method to login, verify login credintials match , a cryptically verifable solution where
				as even if someone downloaded our code could not readily verify what the 
				login code is supposed to be
			B. with admin login, would permit , Table Creation, Deletions, Insertions etc ...

		E. Visualizations:
			A. Default chart types render based on query return
			B. User can select chart types

		F. Reporting:
			A. Format view results for print, as a meeting ready report
